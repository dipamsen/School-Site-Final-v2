            <b>School Infrastructure</b><br>
            At Podar International Schools, we develop our school infrastructure with an aim to maximise the potential of each student to learn, reduce distractions, enhance focus and remove any form of discomfort or difficulty.<br>
            <br>
            Hence our schools are designed incorporating the principles of ergonomics at all levels. Our classrooms are spacious making sure the students can focus on the lesson. We have specially designed furniture in each of our school classrooms that make sure the student is comfortable all throughout the school session. Other facilities include:
            <ul>
            <li>A fully equipped medical centre with requisite first-aid as well as a trained medical professional.</li>
            <li>Safe transport for students to school and back in buses that are comfortable, clean and professionally managed. Each bus has a specially trained driver, lady attendant and a conductor. These buses operate on extensive routes.</li></ul><br>
            <b>Classroom Technology</b><br>
            At Podar International Schools, our teaching methodology expands beyond the boundaries of traditional board and chalk teaching to include technology and modern techniques wherever possible. To help students understand and visually relate to complex concepts, every classroom has been provided with projectors & visualisers. With the help of such technology we make sure our students have a firm grasp on the subject matter and are able to think in three-dimensional space.<br>
            <br>
            <b>The Library</b><br>
            At Podar International Schools, the library is not a sanctum of silence but a world of adventure. With an expansive collection of books on every facet of every subject, Podar International Schools take a no-expense-spared approach to stocking the library. Since we train our students to ask questions, we also inculcate in them the curiosity for research and give them the perfect playground for finding out more about everything.
